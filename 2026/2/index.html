He had a technique, in his case Anamorphosis, and it seems that he wanted to use it no matter what. I have been learning some drawing techniques lately, one is <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=NEdxacojZjU">how to draw patterns of linked curves</a> and it is so satisfying that I want to draw linked curves on all my comics no matter what. When I feel this way it is usually time to stop looking for new techniques and start applying what I know. As it stands I can draw in one, two and three point perspective and I can make some nice curved shapes with a compass and ruler. So this month it is time to start applying some of these techniques to settings in the comic story I&apos;m currently drawing and ease off of learning (too many) new ones. </p><p>I went to the Norwich University Fine Art Student show in <a href="https://www.artinnorwich.org.uk/the-undercroft.html">The Undercroft</a> and there was one artist exhibiting at the very far end of the gallery who had a ring-bound folder full of castles and cavernous halls and stairways inhabited by lots of different people all hand drawn in pencil on printer paper. This student had made a world of their own with a brilliant enthusiasm and it was a good reminder that passion does come through when someone sets their imagination free. </p><p>I thought I would share a little bit about how the comic I am currently working on came about. The Stilton story started by being about fragile knowledge and a home that doesn&apos;t work. It was one of the first things I wrote where the setting created the characters and the characters created the setting. One character responds to being in an uncertain world with a driving enthusiasm to solve problems, using all the tricks at their disposal to bring a little group together shaped by delicate knowledge that mostly disintegrates as it is touched leaving only what holds true. Another mouse balances the safety of being alone with a deep love of showing others how to do things for themselves. One mouse explores the art of suggestion partly by accident. One mouse explores the dangers of the world through dreams that span the entire story. Another mouse has had strange experiences that they are trying to reconcile.  All the characters are trying to understand their situation and each other and it this interconnection in the story that I really enjoy.    </p><p>That brings me on to how I respond to my own uncertain world as a cartoonist. At the end of last June <a href="https://objectgroup.uk/2025/07">I went to MaccPow comic festival</a>. The organiser Mark has been building up MaccPow over the past ten years and that&apos;s what it takes to make a vibrant small comic scene, they don&apos;t exist unless someone with passion commits to building something where nothing existed before. This personal website is a first step of building something as a cartoonist for me. I committed to making this site as easy to maintain as possible and it seems to be working, there are still many improvements I can make but the basics are here. A next step I thought could be to add a web ring for a small comic community. I have seen some <a href="https://webring.xxiivv.com/#random">nicely designed web rings</a> that look manageable so it seems right to give it a try. </p></article><nav><h4 class="past"><a href='https://objectgroup.uk/2026/1/index.html'>past</a></h4></nav></main><footer>	<p class="footer">This is the website of a person who takes things they care about and makes comic stories around them.
